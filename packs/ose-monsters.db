Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.</li>\n<li><strong>Pride:</strong> Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will always listen to flattery.</li>\n<li><strong>Attack pattern:</strong> A dragon always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of either).</li>\n<li><strong>Breath weapon: </strong>Can be used up to three times per day. All caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon&rsquo;s current hit points (Evasion save for half).

The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping: </strong>The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!</li>\n<li><strong>Subduing: </strong>Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks (see Subduing, under Other Combat Issues), admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000 SP per hp.</li>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and &frac14; or &frac12; as much treasure.

Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping: </strong>The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies.

Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping: </strong>The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies.
