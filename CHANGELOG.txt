## New in 0.7.3
* Re-refixed Attribute Modifiers
* Monster movement now allows text input
* Languages spoken now reflect the Know/Connect calculations from WWN
    * Literacy has been left as a holdover from OSE in case any DMs wish to use it; it has no direct corollary in WWN
* The list of languages now reflect those listed in Languages of the Gyre in WWN
    * Preterite is not included, as the text implies you cannot truly learn it as a language
    * Languages can be added or deleted at a system level in system settings
## New in 0.7.2
* Fixed bugs with the Attribute Modifier tweaks
* Fixed a couple Initiative bugs
* Movement now correctly reflects the WWN system
* Fixed data type on most number fields (can now change value with mouse wheel)
## New in 0.7.1
* Added Adventuring Gear to Compendium
* Changed Armor Class Tweak to apply to Naked AC as opposed to final AC
    * This should better support certain Foci and effects
* Added Tweaks for Attribute Modifiers to support Developed Attribute and some Origin Foci
* Added Monster Skill to monster sheet, along with associated roll
## New in 0.7.0
* Fixed Group Initiative die type
    * Thanks to Discord user BWebby for pointing this out
* Separated Foci into their own tab
* Party sheet (small button in the actors pane, below Create Actor) now functions again
    * This now shows useful information but needs more formatting work
* Added support for Specialist and similar Foci in the Tweaks menu
    * Characters created before update will need to open and close the Tweaks menu once before Skill Rolls function correctly
* Compendium now includes all Arts and Spells from the Free Version
    * Thanks to reddit user Studbeastank for doing a lot of the legwork on this. I removed the Arts/Spells from the Deluxe edition but left the artwork edits he made to support those should users wish to manually add them in their games.
    * I have done my best to catch any changes/additions from the newest Beta version (0.19) of WWN but please point out anything I've missed.
