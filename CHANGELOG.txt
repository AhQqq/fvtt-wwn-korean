## New in 0.8.3
* Fixed bug that prevented monsters' Shock damage from displaying
* Arts, Foci, Items, and Armor are now rollable and will display to chat
    * This required changing the Art template a bit. It didn't affect that many Arts so I didn't bother adding logic to fix existing Arts. I did update all the Arts in the Compendium though, so you can simply replace any existing Arts on your sheet if you want Arts like Rune of Destruction to display a damage forumla in the chat card.
* Extended input field focus implementation to item sheets.
* Fixed armor type for Plate Armor and its magic derivatives.
* Added a Bank field under currency for SP stored somewhere. Doesn't count against Encumbrance.
* Added a Treasure field that expresses the total value of any inventory items marked as "Treasure". This is intended to be gems or jewelry that can easily be exchanged at a given value but you could use it for just about any valuable commodity.
* Added a Total field that calculates your total SP value from coin and bank values, as well as the value of any inventory item marked as treasure.
* Added Renown field to character sheet header.
* Saving Throw dialogs now include the character making the saving throw, to better support the GM rolling saves for multiple tokens at once.
* Expanded the GM Tables to include History Construction, Historical Events,
## New in 0.8.2
* Rolling for silver on a new character now correctly assigns SP to the character when done.
    * Fixing this first required breaking the character generation dialog and then fixing it again. If something seems off, let me know.
* Fixed field input focus on tab--fields should remain highlighted, allowing for quick input of new characters and monsters. This was driving me nuts.
    * Shoutout to the magnificent Moo Man for helping me figure this one out!
* Monster saves now auto-calculate based on monster HD. This will function whether you put 3d6, 3D6, or simply 3.
* Implemented saving throw tweaks for all actors.
## New in 0.8.1
* Fix for monster Effort tracking
## New in 0.8.0
* Critical bugfix for player attacks
## New in 0.7.9
* Enabled Effort tracking for monsters
* Made default width of monster sheet slightly wider
* Removed "Retainer" from Tweaks dialog for monsters, as they already have morale and don't need it listed twice
* Monster Movement Details now correctly allows text again
* Fixed currency bug that was affecting new characters
* Replaced treasure table on monster sheet with instinct table
* Characters and monsters now have different default HD, as per the book
* Instinct and Morale checks now pause to ask about modifiers
* Styled the Tweaks dialog (monster tweaks looks funny for now)
* Fixed bug that sometimes interfered with monster weapon attacks
* PC saves now auto-calculate based on stat mods and level
    * This doesn't currently have a way to tweak it.
* Overhauled movement:
    * Both WWN and BX movement now use encounter movement as a base (30 and 40 feet per round, respectively)
    * WWN Overland movement now correctly reflects the 30 mile per day standard assumed for plains or savannah
    * There is now a Movement Bonus Tweak. This number is applied as a flat bonus or malus on top of the encounter movement rate, after encumbrance penalties have been figured.
    * When the Calculate Movement toggle (in character tweaks) is off, all three fields (if visible) are editable
## New in 0.7.8
* Fix for spell preparation blunder that broke sheet updates
* Some of the early GM tools intended for next update: generators for Nation, Soceity, and Government Construction
## New in 0.7.7
* Compendium additions
    * Complete list of magical armors, weapons, elixers, and devices.
    * Generators for the above. The Magic Item Masters contain the high level tables, while the Magic Item Tables contains the countless subtables required to make the whole thing work.
        * Generators should work regardless, but you will have better results (auto-rolls on subtables) if you have the Better RollTables module.
        * Magic Armors and Weapons will output the correct item to chat. Bonuses are already figured for AC, damage, and Shock. Special Abilities are output to chat but you will have to copy those into the item description yourself. Maybe take this opportunity to give it a cool name instead of Generic Magic Warhammer #47.
        * Magical devices have no suggested weight in the beta. I have taken the liberty of assigning values that made sense to me. If you disagree, feel free to duplicate the Compendium (or import specific items) and assign values you find more appropriate.
    * Added Greatclubs, as this was apparently missing before.
    * Finished fleshing out the Instinct tables.
* Spells now have a checkbox to denote whether they are prepared. This is purely cosmetic and for the player's benefit. The system does no checks to ensure you prepare the correct number of spells or prevent you from casting a spell that isn't prepared. Use your own brain.
    * The checkbox is currently a little buggy. Will fix later.
* Re-refixed monster movement allowing text input. For real this time.
* Attack Attribute is now automatically added to Shock damage.
* Inverted the logic on spell slots from slots left to slots used so as to match the logic of Effort tracking and the column header. The numbers going opposite directions, despite being next to each other, was counter-inuitive. Hitting reset will now reset the Committed column of spell slots to zero.
## New in 0.7.6
* Compendium fixes
* Items Cost -> Price
## New in 0.7.5
* Re-refixed Attribute Modifiers
* Monster movement now allows text input better handle multiple movement types
    * Monsters may now move 30 parsecs per turn, if you so wish
* Languages spoken now reflect the Know/Connect calculations from WWN
    * Literacy has been left as a holdover from OSE in case any DMs wish to use it; it has no direct corollary in WWN
* The list of languages now reflect those listed in Languages of the Gyre in WWN
    * Preterite is not included, as the text implies you cannot truly learn it as a language
    * Languages can be added or deleted at a system level in system settings
* Currency as a character attribute and reported at the top of the inventory page
    * System setting toggles between WWN standard (SP/GP only) and B/X standard (adds CP/EP/PP)
    * Coins are divided by 200 and added to Stowed inventory calculations, as per the book
    * Coins have been removed from the Compendium
* Items only store a current quantity now instead of current/max
    * I was too dumb to make a proper migration script, so you will lose current item quantities -- sorry!
* With the previous two changes, the system should now be compatible with Better RollTables, for loot table goodness
    * The Roll button will output your loot table to the chat window
    * The Generate Loot button will not function for WWN until I or someone else gets around to creating a WWN-specific version of the Loot Sheet NPC module
* Added support for Psychic Skills from Stars Without number
    * The skills may be enabled through system settings
    * I suppose I should also make them togglable on a per-character basis but I was feeling lazy
* Spellcasting now reflects WWN standards
## New in 0.7.2
* Fixed bugs with the Attribute Modifier tweaks
* Fixed a couple Initiative bugs
* Movement now correctly reflects the WWN system
* Fixed data type on most number fields (can now change value with mouse wheel)
## New in 0.7.1
* Added Adventuring Gear to Compendium
* Changed Armor Class Tweak to apply to Naked AC as opposed to final AC
    * This should better support certain Foci and effects
* Added Tweaks for Attribute Modifiers to support Developed Attribute and some Origin Foci
* Added Monster Skill to monster sheet, along with associated roll
## New in 0.7.0
* Fixed Group Initiative die type
    * Thanks to Discord user BWebby for pointing this out
* Separated Foci into their own tab
* Party sheet (small button in the actors pane, below Create Actor) now functions again
    * This now shows useful information but needs more formatting work
* Added support for Specialist and similar Foci in the Tweaks menu
    * Characters created before update will need to open and close the Tweaks menu once before Skill Rolls function correctly
* Compendium now includes all Arts and Spells from the Free Version
    * Thanks to reddit user Studbeastank for doing a lot of the legwork on this. I removed the Arts/Spells from the Deluxe edition but left the artwork edits he made to support those should users wish to manually add them in their games.
    * I have done my best to catch any changes/additions from the newest Beta version (0.19) of WWN but please point out anything I've missed.
